Something we're not going to get to in this workshop, but is worth mentioning is
what to do if your backend data is slow, but you want to show something to the
user immediately (even if it is a useless skeleton screen).

In Remix, you can use
[streaming and defer](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/streaming) to do
this. For a demo of this, check out Ryan Florence's video on
[deferred rendering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StZt-WrI2to&list=PLXoynULbYuEApkwAGZ7U7LmL-BDHloB0l).
